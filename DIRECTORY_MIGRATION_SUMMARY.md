# Directory Migration Summary

## Problem

The revalidation job system was using `/tmp/revalidation-jobs` which is ephemeral on Vercel serverless functions and gets cleared between invocations, causing job status files to disappear.

## Solution

Migrated to a persistent directory structure within the project:

- Primary: `data/revalidation-jobs/`
- Fallback: `jobs/`

## Files Updated

### 1. src/pages/api/revalidate-status.ts

- ✅ Updated `getJobsDir()` to use `data/revalidation-jobs/`
- ✅ Added write access test before using directory
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. src/pages/api/revalidate-optimized.ts

- ✅ Updated `getJobsDir()` to match revalidate-status.ts
- ✅ Consistent directory logic across all files
- ✅ Same fallback mechanism

### 3. src/pages/api/revalidate-file.ts

- ✅ Updated to use same directory structure
- ✅ Consistent with other revalidation endpoints

### 4. .gitignore

- ✅ Added `/data/revalidation-jobs/` to exclude job files from git
- ✅ Added `/jobs/` fallback directory exclusion

### 5. New Structure Created

- ✅ Created `data/` directory
- ✅ Created `data/revalidation-jobs/` subdirectory
- ✅ Added `data/README.md` with documentation

## Benefits

1. **Persistent Storage**: Job files won't disappear between function calls
2. **Consistent Paths**: All revalidation endpoints use identical directory logic
3. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging shows exactly which directory is being used
4. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Multiple fallback options if primary directory fails
5. **Clean Git**: Job files excluded from version control

## Testing

- Created `src/pages/api/test-directory.ts` for testing directory operations
- All files compile without errors
- Directory structure verified and ready for use

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual webhook calls
2. Monitor job persistence across function invocations
3. Implement cleanup for old job files (optional)

The revalidation system should now maintain job status reliably across serverless function restarts.
